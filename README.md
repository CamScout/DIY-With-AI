DIY With AI Website

#### Video Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFQC6AfyAHc

#### Description:
DIY With AI is a static website designed to help individuals integrate AI into their DIY projects. The site features standard navigation tabs: Home, About, Projects, Media, and Contact, providing valuable resources and information on AI-enhanced DIY projects.

## Website Tabs
### Home
The Home page serves as the introductory page. Even this first page introduction offers the client this welcoming and compelling invitation to: “Discover how AI can simplify your DIY projects.” The Home page contains the following tabs for navigation to additional pages (Home, About, Services, Projects, Contact, and Media). When clicking into each tab, the color of the word changes from white to Lavender. 

### About
The About page provides foundational information and outlines our beliefs, our mission, and an invitation to learn how to effectively integrate AI into DIY.

### Services
The Services page describes what tasks and projects DIY with AI can help with. Listed are each service with a short description such as: AI-Powered Tax Preparation, AI Assistance for Business Setup and Operations, AI-Driven Landscaping and Home Improvement and Inspiring Others through AI Education.

### Projects
The Projects tab features DIY projects that incorporate AI tools and techniques. Each project includes an engaging project title coupled with a fun, descriptive image. 

### Contact
The Contact page requires no storage of information; it simply offers my email address for further interaction. I chose this structure to minimize data security concerns. This also made my javascript program simple and easy to build and understand.  

### Media
The Media tab showcases a video of one of my Landscaping Design Video Projects I created using Canva.
